Grzegorz - a minimal pair generator.

~~Maybe deciding to start learning Polish wasn't a good choice.~~ I spent an
hour looking for a list of minimal pairs in Polish but in vain, I found nothing.
And so it struck me: I can just get a frequency list, slam it into a minimal
pair generator, and create my own list! But getting the pronunciations for such
a long list of words manually? No, I had to incorporate a pronunciation scraper
into this project. So practically, you give Grzegorz a list of words in plain
text, every word on its own line, and then the minimal pair generator is ran.
