# What are minimal pairs?

Minimal pairs are pairs of words that differ only very slightly, or, as
linguists say, by one *phonological unit*, although that's just jargon. Case in
point, they can differ:

- by one sound (linguist jargon: *phoneme*) - e.g. English "bat" and "pat",
    French "rue" and "roux"
- by one tone (linguist jargon: *toneme*) - languages like Mandarin and
    Vietnamese have tones
- by the length of a sound (linguist jargon: *chroneme*) - e.g. Italian "vile"
    and "ville",
- when the stress is put on different syllables - e.g. English "address" (noun
    and verb), Greek "παπά" (priest) and "πάπα" (Pope).

For linguists, minimal pairs are most often used to "prove" that two
phonological units are different within a language.

But, for the average person, minimal pairs have a more practical use - language
learning! You can make tests with them: being given the audio pronunciation of a
word, you'll have to choose the word that you think was pronounced. Remember,
the more similar the sounds, the harder it is to get it correct! Also, note that
this "test" is made for both words, so you get to hear both pronunciations. With
time, after testing yourself consistently, you'll be able to better distinguish
the seemingly similar sounds of your target language.
